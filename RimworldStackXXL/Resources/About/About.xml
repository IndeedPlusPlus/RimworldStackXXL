Stack XXL

Increase the stack sizes however you wish!
Want 10x, 20x or even 100x? Want to set different stack sizes for meat, meals and resources?
You came to the right place!

Requirement: HugsLib

IMPORTANT: PLEASE RESTART YOUR GAME AFTER CHANGING MOD SETTINGS!

- Set stack size multipliers. Want 10x or 100x? you name it!
- Set multiplier specified to each category. For example you can make meat stack to 750 (10x) while making meals stack to 300 (30x), maybe to balance thing out.
